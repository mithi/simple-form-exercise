## Notes

My first intention was to use Ant Design but decided not to.
This is because Ant Design's form and modal as it's generating a warning (`Warning: findDOMNode is deprecated in StrictMode`) [see issue #2613 for more information](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/26136) So I opted to use `Formik`, `yup`, and `@react/dialog` here.
